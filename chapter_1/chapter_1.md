# Chapter 1: Preliminaries

## 1.1: Abstract Syntax Trees

We start by taking a look at Abstract Syntax Trees - or how compilers decide what each part of a program statement is trying to do.

My first instinct was to recreate the Constant class from the book and then create an instance of it to see it in action. When I tried to get a `Constant()` I got this:

```
<__main__.Constant object at 0x1021d0350>
```

And while I should mention that I rather enjoy Python's ability to show you memory addresses (which is almost completely absent in JavaScript), this isn't exactly what I was expecting. In pressing further with the book's examples, I soon realized that in looking at the `ast` library in Python's docs that everything I was doing was already there!

Another fun note: maybe it's because it's been WAY TOO LONG since I defined classes in Python, but the "autocomplete" for `def __init__` ended up adding `-> None` every time I used it. I believe that this is an optional thing in order to improve readability (essentially, it's borrowing the idea of having to define the type of a function's return value from more type safe languages), but in checking it out further, it doesn't seem to affect the program's ability to run if you try to be cheeky with it...

## 1.2: Grammars

This section seems to be more of a theoretical chapter rather than a practical one, but it's still important to understand the theory behind what's going on when compiling a program. However, I'll be honest: I'm not *entirely* sure what's going on here.

...Or at least I wasn't on my first read through. This leads me to some more general advice I think most people 

Don't be afraid to wait.

I think with how employers are asking for these wide skillsets nowadays, people are insanely tempted to move on from one topic to the next

Anyway, back to THIS book, the basic rules are laid out using a "smaller language" called L<sub>int</sub>. While going over every single rule here might be a bit pedantic, I think going over the "gist" of the ruleset may help: It divides everything we've declared so far into *expressions* and *statements*. Most of what we have from the last module are in the *expressions* category: constants, our operators, and an empty function call are expressions, while printing things, as well as stating a variable itself, are statements.

In addition, we add a `Module` class to tie everything together.

## 1.3: Pattern Matching

We start by introduing something rather new: Python's `match` keyword. It was added in Python 3.10 back in 2021, and is, in essence, a Python version of the `switch` statement found in other languages like JavaScript (i.e. a way ot grouping if/elif statements).

As an example of this, the book takes all of the classes we've been using so far and determines whether or not they are leaf nodes of an AST (i.e. is there more logic below ). In our case, the Constant and Call classes are leaves, but the unary and binary operators are not as there is other logic we need to figure out before we hit the leaf nodes.

(Coincidentally, I tried writing this out and got an error that immplied that I wasn't using Python 3.10 or newer; I checked my version and it was 3.11 and the code ran fine)
